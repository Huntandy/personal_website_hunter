HHow to use webpack to create a vue.js project
To create a Vue.js project using Webpack, you can follow these steps:
Install Vue CLI:

If you haven't already, install Vue CLI globally by running:
Install Vue CLI ===> npm install -g @vue/cli
Create a New Vue Project:

Use Vue CLI to create a new project. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run:
Create Project ===> vue create my-vue-project
Select Configuration:

Vue CLI will prompt you to select a preset. Choose the default preset (Vue 3, Babel, ESLint) 
or manually select features based on your project requirements.
Navigate to Project Directory:

Move into your project directory:
Move intro Project Directory ===> cd my-vue-project
Install Webpack:

Webpack is already included in Vue CLI projects by default, so you don't need to install it separately.
Run the Project:

Start the development server to run your Vue project:
Start Server ===> npm run serve
Build the Project:

To build the project for production, run:
Build Project ===> npm run build
Configuration (Optional):

If you need to customize Webpack configuration, you can do so by creating a vue.config.js file in the root of your project. 
Here you can modify the Webpack configuration using the configureWebpack option.
By following these steps, you can create a Vue.js project using Vue CLI, 
which comes preconfigured with Webpack to handle module bundling and development server setup. 
This allows you to quickly set up and start working on your Vue.js project without having to manually configure Webpack.
